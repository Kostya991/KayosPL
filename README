Well uh.
It`s an Kayos Programming Language/KPL.
Now it`s an Alpha 0.2.1.
It`s an interpreter of my language wroten on Python.
some commands\code things:
console.prnt("text here") (example: console.prnt("notOpened"))
varVariable_Name = number or text (example: varOpened = 1 or varOpened = no)
save.file {based} - creates main.kpf and writes a code in it from interpreter


console.prnt(Variable_Name) - it will print value of variable
console.inpt("") or console.inpt("text: ") - i cant add a variable print\input there but its input now!


varVariable_Name = float("number1", "+ or * or - or /", "number2") - calculate "number1" and "number2"
console.prnt(Variable_Name) - print result

It`s only 6 things i added and I`m gonna add other things later.
You can ask me on 'Discussions' and request things in 'Pull requests'.
