~I made a new look for a code~
It`s 0.3.0 alpha now!
So, i made it to interpret the file 'main.txt'

so, there is a some things i made and a docs for KayosProgrammingLanguage/KPL

--------------CODE--------------

@use:akabase - its basic module that allows you to make basic console program or idk what else

start: - start of the code
varXD = 'xd' - variable and its value after '='
console.prnt(XD) - prints value of variable
console.inpt("") - allows you to print
@xdddasdjkaksfjnasl - commentary thing
end - ends it all



--------------OUTPUT--------------
xd

----------------------------------


without the module akabase it won`t do anything
and yes, without any '' or "" in console.prnt, only prints value of variables
fun fact: akabase is AKA. BASE
Like it`s BASIC things for a program to make on my simple 'programming language'
i will add float, if, else soon (i can`t realise them for now
