Well uh.
It`s an Kayos Programming Language/KPL.
Now it`s an Alpha 0.1.0.
It`s an interpreter of my language wroten on Python.
some commands\code things:
console.prnt(text here) (example: console.prnt(notOpened))
varVariableName = number or text (example: varOpened = 1 or varOpened = no)
save.file {based} - creates main.kpf and writes a code in it from interpreter
It`s only 3 and I`m gonna add other things later.

You can ask me on 'Discussions' and request things in 'Pull requests'.
